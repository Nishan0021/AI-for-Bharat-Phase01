🌱 AI for Bharat – Phase 01
AI-Powered Government Scheme Eligibility & Explainer System

AI for Bharat – Phase 01 is a citizen-centric web application designed to help people easily discover government schemes they are eligible for and understand them in simple language. The system combines rule-based eligibility logic with AI-powered explanation and translation, making government welfare information accessible to everyone, especially users with low digital literacy.

This project focuses on transparency, accessibility, and responsible AI usage. AI is used only for simplification, translation, and explanation, while all eligibility decisions are made using clearly defined rules.
